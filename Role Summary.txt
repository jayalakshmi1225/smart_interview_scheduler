Role Summary
As a Graduate Machine Learning Engineer, you’ll join a dynamic team to design, develop, test, and deploy cutting-edge machine learning models to support HSBC’s strategic initiatives (e.g., fraud detection, risk management, customer insight, personalization). This entry-level position offers structured training, mentoring, and exposure across multiple domains including data engineering, model development, and ML operations.

Key Responsibilities
Support the design and development of ML models (e.g., classification, clustering, regression).

Assist with data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Participate in feature engineering and selection processes.

Help with hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation using evaluation metrics like accuracy, AUC, F1, RMSE, etc.

Implement and maintain ML model pipelines using tools like Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Engage with stakeholders to understand business requirements and translate them into ML solutions.

Assist with model deployment using MLOps tools or frameworks (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow).

Document experiments, findings, and model behavior for transparency and compliance.

What You’ll Learn
Best practices in handling financial data, ensuring data quality, and addressing compliance requirements.

HSBC’s approach to responsible AI, fairness, ethics, and model interpretability.

Collaboration with cross-functional teams: data science, engineering, product, risk, and business units.

Real-world deployment of ML models in production environments.

Technical skills involving financial services applications such as risk scoring, customer segmentation, credit modeling, or anomaly detection.

Qualifications
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, or related field (completed within the past 2 years).

Strong foundation in machine learning algorithms and basic statistics.

Proficiency in Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn; familiarity with deep learning frameworks is a plus.

Hands-on experience with at least one ML project—coursework, thesis, hackathons, or internship.

Excellent analytical skills and ability to work with structured and unstructured data.

Eagerness to learn, adapt, and work in an agile, collaborative environment.

Basic exposure to SQL, version control (Git), cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP), Docker, or CI/CD pipelines is a plus.

Fluent in English; additional languages (local to the region you're applying in) are an advantage.

Why HSBC?
Structured graduate development programs with mentorship and rotational opportunities.

Global scale, complex challenges, and exposure to a wide range of financial use cases.

Commitment to innovation, diversity, and ethical AI practices.

Competitive compensation, learning budget, and inclusive work culture.
